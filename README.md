### Setup

*For nerd: There is only a `client` now, which is built around [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/), [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/), and [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). And I am using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)*.

1. Clone and install

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/huynhtehoa/random-shit.git

    cd random-shit/client

    pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
    ```

2. Install [`eslint` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) (this is for `vscode`, it varies for different editors)

3. Start the development server on <http://localhost:3000>

    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
